# Contributing to crypto-listings-sniper

We love your input! ðŸš€ We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- [Reporting a bug](https://github.com/rickstaa/crypto-listings-sniper/issues).
- [Discussing the current state of the code](https://github.com/rickstaa/crypto-listings-sniper/discussions).
- [Submitting a fix](https://github.com/rickstaa/crypto-listings-sniper/pulls).
- [Proposing new features](https://github.com/rickstaa/crypto-listings-sniper/issues).
- Becoming a maintainer.
- [Providing translations](https://crowdin.com/project/crypto-listings-sniper/).

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add tests if you've added code that should be tested.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (i.e. `go test ./...`).
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Build the golang package using the `go build` command.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rickstaa/crypto-listings-sniper/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rickstaa/crypto-listings-sniper/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report, and I think it's a good model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer greatly respected in the community.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce:
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [A stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce the error.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We use [gofmt](https://go.dev/blog/gofmt) formatter to format our Golang code. The easiest way to use [gofmt](https://go.dev/blog/gofmt) is through the [vscode-go](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go) VS Code extensions.
